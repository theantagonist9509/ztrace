# ztrace
Toy raytracer written in Zig 0.11

`zig build run` to build and run

Edit `example.json` to change scene parameters

Edit `main.zig` to specify number of threads and maximum depth for raytracing

(Will change it so that source json file, number of threads and maximum depth can be passed as command line arguments)
